##How to run the script

Download the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
Unzip the folder into the same location where your run_analysis.R script is located 

Open the run_analysis.R script in R. Set your working directory to your local repository folder and source the script.

The script will run its analysis and transformations, producing in the end a new file called "new_dataset.txt"
